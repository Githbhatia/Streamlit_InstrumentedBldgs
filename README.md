Read and plot CISMIP formated v2 instrumented building earthquake motion records such as posted on CESMD website (Center of Strong Motion Data https://www.strongmotioncenter.org/). The code can also be used to view building instrument records on the CESMD site and those also available at the HCAI website (https://hcai.ca.gov/construction-finance/facility-detail/ - navigate to a hospital that has instrumented buildings and look under the Instrumented Buildings Tab). Python code reads a zip file containing .v2 files that contains multiple channels (Instrumented Buildings have records for individual channels zipped together)
